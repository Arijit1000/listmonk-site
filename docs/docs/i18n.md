# Internationalization (i18n)

listmonk comes available in multiple languages thanks to language packs contributed by volunteers. A language pack is a JSON file with a map of keys and corresponding translations. The available languages can be [seen here](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/tree/master/i18n).

## Contributing a language pack

- Visit [https://listmonk.app/i18n](https://listmonk.app/i18n)
- To make changes to an existing language, use the "Load language" option on the top right.
- To create a new language, use the "Load language" option on the top right and select "Default".
- Translate the text in the input fields on the UI.
- Once done, use the `Switch to raw JSON` and copy the JSON data and save it to a file named `xx.json`, where `xx` is the two letter code of the language.
- Send a pull request to add the file to the [i18n directory on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/tree/master/i18n). If you are not familiar with pull requests, share the file by creating a new "issue"  (comment) on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/issues)
